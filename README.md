# **Quiz App Project** ðŸŽ‰

## **Overview**

Welcome to the **Quiz App Project**! ðŸš€

You can access the application directly in your browser here: [http://3.106.224.18](http://3.106.224.18).

> **Note:** The application is currently not SSL-certified. However, for efficiency, SSL certification and a custom domain will be added as part of future enhancements.

## Features

- **Home Screen**: The home screen contains 2 buttons. Each button starts one of the two activities
- **Activity One Screen**: Activity one's flow includes a series of flat questions.
- **Activity Two Screen**: Activity two's flow includes a series of rounds with questions.
- **Result Screen**: Displays the score to the user after each eactivity, and also includes a button to link to the home screen

## This project consists of two main components:

1. **Web Application**: A front-end quiz application developed using React, TypeScript, and Vite, where users can participate in quizzes and receive instant feedback.
2. **Web Service**: A backend service built with Node.js and Express, designed to fetch quiz data from a remote JSON source. It functions as a proxy server to retrieve S3 payloads while bypassing CORS restrictions. Additionally, it can be extended to provide separate endpoints for validation, data processing, and other enhancements.

## Getting Started

To run the project:

1. Start the Web Application (webapp) check out the [WebApp README](webapp/README.md)
2. Start the Web Service (webservice) check out the [WebService README](webservice/README.md)
3. Open the web app in your browser and start taking quizzes! ðŸŽ‰

## Architecture

Note: Express is provisioned as a proxy server to fetch S3 payload to bypass CORS issues

## **Future Improvements** ðŸš€

- **Enhance Backend Functionality**: Instead of using the backend solely as a proxy, extend it to provide dedicated endpoints for validation, data processing, and additional features. This will help prevent quiz answers from being exposed to client-side inspection.
- **Optimize State Management**: Instead of relying on location state, consider implementing a more scalable state management solution as the application grows in complexity.
- **Dynamic Activity Identification**: Improve the structure of `ActivityOne` and `ActivityTwo` by dynamically identifying each activity type within the payload. This ensures that new activity types are automatically integrated without requiring manual adjustments.
- **Database Integration**: Implement a database to store user data and quiz results, enabling better tracking and persistence.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**: Automate deployment and streamline the development process by implementing a CI/CD pipeline, including:
  - **Containerizing the Application** for better scalability and portability.
  - **Configuring Environment Variables** to manage application settings across different environments.
